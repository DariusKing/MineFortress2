# TF2Minigame
This is a Spigot minigame (With no official name yet), which is a remake of the Valve game Team Fortress 2.
This minigame so far features fully customizable guns from a spreadsheet file (In .xlsx format), melee and primary
guns, snipers, and fully/semi automatic guns. For the ammo and clip visual, I have recreated the regular TF2 ammo bar with a resourcepack.
Full gamemodes should be comming soon, and all that comes with them.
