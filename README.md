About The Game
-------------
Mine Fortress 2 is a remake of the popular game [Team Fortress 2](http://www.teamfortress.com/ "Team Fortress 2") (TF2). All of the default guns from the original game are remade with the same specifications from TF2, along with classes, and a never before seen seamless GUI for clips, remaining ammo, health, and metal. Mine Fortress 2 has its own custom made map to go with the PvP gamemode, and soon the [Control Points](https://wiki.teamfortress.com/wiki/Control_Point_%28game_mode%29) gamemode.

How To Play
-------------
**To get the game working, you need to make you sure you followed the correct instillation steps found in the next section of this page.**

When you first get on your server, make sure to enable the MF2 vX.X Resourcepack. To start a game, type in chat **/mf2 start**. Everyone will be teleported into an area to choose a team. Right click the "Random" door for the system to choose a team at random for you, "Red" to choose the red team, and "Blue" to choose the blue team. Click the door of the team you want, and you will be teleported to that team's base. Next, choose your class on the GUI inventory that pops up on the screen. After choosing your class, you will be shown A loadout GUI. All of the loadouts are saved in a database, so you will see your last created loadout on screen. If you want to continue with your current loadout, click ESC. If you want to change any of the weaponary/PDA's, click the item and then click the one you want to replace it with.

To shoot guns, hold right click if it is an automatic gun (Ex. Machine gun, Submachine gun). Ammo can be gained by standing in front of your team's dispenser (Located within a few blocks of your spawn), or ammo packs spawning in certain locations in the map. Health can also be gained by the dispenser as well, and health packs, usually spawning next to ammo packs.

Installation
-------------
The first step in installing Mine Fortress 2 is to download the necessary files from the [uddernetworks website](http://www.uddernetworks.com/download). Unzip the file to see the following files/folders:s
>- MF2
>- MF2 vX.X Map
>- libs.zip
>- MF2 vX.X Resourcepack.zip
>- MineFortress2_vX.X.jar

*(**X.X** is replaced with the version you download from the website.)*
Put **MF2 vX.X Map** in the server's worlds folder. Go to the server's plugins folder and put **MineFortress2_vX.X.jar** into it. Extract **libs.zip** into the plugins folder as well, making sure the jar files found in it are found directly in the **libs** folder in the server's plugin directory. Lastly, put the **MF2** folder in your server's plugin folder as well. You are now free to modify the config file or guns.xlsx.
